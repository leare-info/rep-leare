For a while the web felt like a living place — not polished, but alive. It was full of pages made by individuals who followed curiosity rather than rules. Strange corners, half-finished experiments, loose threads to pull.

That changed as the platforms grew. Our browsing turned into scrolling. Pages disappeared or were folded into feeds. Exploration narrowed.

**leare.info** exists to push back against that flattening. It’s meant as a space to *learn and share*, to surface small and strange things, and to build tools for thinking — so exploration feels alive again.

## A Simple Model for a Living Web

Here’s a first cut at what makes the web feel alive:

- **Messiness & personal expression:** Imperfect.
- **Hyperlinks as connective tissue:** Ideas tied together, not locked in silos.
- **Small experiments & play:** Little tools, odd pages, things that surprise.
- **Archival mindset:** Keeping what we find alive.
- **Quiet clarity over performance:** Not feeds and followers, just good thinking, shared.

This is a starting point — one “variant” of a *Living Web* model. Other posts may explore alternative frames or extend it.

## Explore What’s Left

To see early, alive web examples:  
- [Web Design Museum](/references/web-design-museum) — screenshots and context from 1991–2006.  
- [Wiby](/references/wiby) — a search engine surfacing small, independent sites Google hides.  
- [GifCities](/references/gifcities) — millions of rescued GeoCities GIFs, playful and weird.

## Why It Matters Here

By writing down models like this and linking to living examples, **leare.info** is quietly building a dataset: concepts, nodes, references. Over time, those could feed maps, timelines, or experiments that help people think better and wander further.
